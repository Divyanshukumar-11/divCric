          Ravindra Jadeja, the India all-rounder, has been ruled out of the rest of the T20I series against Australia. Shardul Thakur, the fast bowler, has been added to the squad for the remainder of the series.
          <br><br>
          In a media release, BCCI confirmed that the all-rounder had sustained a concussion after being hit on the head during the closing stages of India's innings in the T20I series opener at Canberra. The 31-year-old is also battling a hamstring injury which he picked up during the course of his innings.
          <br><br>
          Jadeja, who scored an unbeaten 23-ball 44 in the first T20I versus Australia in Canberra, was struck on the left side of his forehead by a Mitchell Starc delivery that ricocheted off the bat in the final over of India's innings.
          <br><br>
          A clinical assessment was conducted during the innings break by the BCCI medical team which confirmed that he had sustained concussion. Subsequently, Yuzvendra Chahal, the leg-spinner, replaced Jadeja as the concussion substitute and emerged as the player of the match following figures of 3 for 25.
          <br><br>
          Jadeja will remain under observation and will undertake additional scans if required as per the assessment on Saturday.
