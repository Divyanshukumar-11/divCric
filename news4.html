          Justin Langer's obvious displeasure at match referee David Boon's decision to allow India a concussion substitute may have had to do with the Australian team not being convinced that Ravindra Jadeja indeed warranted one. It's learnt that the home team were aware that the Indian all-rounder had injured his hamstring quite significantly but weren't entirely sure that the blow he received to the helmet from Mitchell Starc had left him concussed.
          <br><br>
          The fact that Jadeja wasn't given any immediate treatment from the Indian medical staff upon being struck off the second ball of the 20th over only seems to have added to the Australians' scepticism at that point.
          <br><br>
          Langer's outburst during the innings break, where he exchanged some strong words with his former teammate and now match referee, came minutes after when the Aussie camp would have learnt about Yuzvendra Chahal's addition to the Indian playing XI in place of Jadeja.
          <br><br>
          There had been some talk, especially in the commentary box, and from some other voices of note on social media about why the left-hander hadn't been examined the moment he was hit. But by not doing so, the Indians did not breach any protocol in the concussion guidelines set by the ICC. Jadeja could have been assessed at the end of the over but since the incident occurred in the final over of the Indian innings, it didn't eventually matter.
          <br><br>
          It perhaps didn't help the Aussie's take on the matter that Jadeja smashed 9 runs off the remaining 4 balls of the Indian innings. And also that Chahal then came in to knock out three crucial wickets, including that of a well-set Aaron Finch and in-form Steve Smith, and ended up as the man of the match.
          <br><br>
          The news from the Indian camp regarding Jadeja's hamstring is worrying for now, and it's said to be "not good". It should more or less rule him out of the remainder of the T20I series but with the start of the Test series still 12 days away, there's not expected to be a decision taken on his availability anytime soon.
          <br><br>
          India's version of events is that Jadeja had been "feeling dizzy" ever since he returned to the dressing-room and that the medical staff were left with no option but to call for a concussion substitute.
          <br><br>
          "He got hit on the helmet in the last over (off Mitchell Starc) and when he came back to the dressing room, he was asked by the physio (Nitin Patel) how he felt. He said that he was feeling a little dizzy. He is under observation as per team doctor's (Dr Abhijit Salvi) advice," is how Sanju Samson described the sequence of events to the media at the end of the day. Indian captain Virat Kohli too had spoken about Jadeja having felt dizzy from the time he came back in to even after the game.
