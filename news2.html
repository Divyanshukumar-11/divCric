          The only time cricket has come close to an actual "like for like" scenario during an active match before concussion substitutes came along is probably when "runners" were still allowed. Back then it wasn't so much a case of there being a likeliness between two individuals but more to do with their attire. The rules for runners were that the player coming in to assist the injured or fatigued batsmen had to wear the "same external protective equipment" as his partner and carry a bat. But at least there was a sense of tangibility to those guidelines. Unlike with the "like for like" used in a concussion substitute context.
          <br><br>
          Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravindra Jadeja aren't built the same, they don't bowl with the same hand and even their beards don't look the same. But on Friday (December 4) at the Manuka Oval, they were deemed as being "like for like". And even if Justin Langer might not have agreed with it, as specialist spinners the two were in some ways interchangeable-especially since it wasn't a question of Jadeja coming out to bat in place of Chahal.
          <br><br>
          India's success in Canberra though wasn't just orchestrated by their concussion substitute. Chahal did of course make the telling breakthroughs early in the play, taking out both Aaron Finch and Steve Smith. But the real impetus of the win was laid by the visitors' 'unlike for like' replacements for those who played in the ODI series last week. While Chahal made the overall difference, the groundwork for his success was laid by T20 specialists Washington Sundar and Deepak Chahar. It
          was a far cry from the pace that the Australians faced in the 50-over format with Jasprit Bumrah rested and Mohammed Shami bowling first-change.
          <br><br>
          Chahar may have started a little expensively but came back to trouble Steve Smith with an excellent spell, where he also had two catches dropped off consecutive balls. He eventually got rid of Moises Henriques, who'd shown some resistance. Sundar, meanwhile, did what he does better than most T20 off-spinners, give nothing away to the Aussie batsman, finishing up with remarkable figures of 0/16 in 4 overs. The killer blows came from T Natarajan, who was initially supposed to be, like Sundar and Chahar, one of those unlike for like replacements for the T20I leg of the tour.
