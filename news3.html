          Matthew Wade and Glenn Maxwell cracked impressive fifties while the spin duo of Adam Zampa and Mitchell Swepson picked up crucial wickets to help Australia clinch a consolation win in the final T20I against India in Sydney. With the loss, the visitors' unbeaten run of 10 wins in the shortest format also came to an end.

          <p style="font-weight:200%">How did India start the chase?</p>
          <br>
          While pursuing a sizeable target of 187 on a slightly two-paced deck, the visitors would have hoped for a good start. However, KL Rahul fell in the very first over which was bowled by Glenn Maxwell. Virat Kohli, who was given a reprieve off Maxwell, and Shikhar Dhawan then laid the platform. Kohli flicked, cut and drove Australian bowlers to the boundary hoarding while Dhawan too collected a few boundaries as they managed 55 in the powerplay.

          <p style="font-weight:150%">How did Australia respond?</p>
          <br>
          Spin turned out to be a vital weapon for Australia in the post-powerplay period. The visitors struggled to push the scoring rate against the two legspinners, especially Mitchell Swepson, who also landed crucial blows by dismissing Dhawan, Sanju Samson and Shreyas Iyer to peg India back. With the required run-rate mounting, Kohli and Hardik Pandya cracked a few powerful blows before Hardik holed one out to Aaron Finch and Kohli was dislodged by Tye. Eventually, the visitors fell 12 runs short. Meanwhile, Zampa and Swepson proved to be the telling difference between the two sides, giving away 44 runs and picking up four wickets between them.

          <p style="font-weight:150%">A contest of twists and turns</p>
          <br>
          The keenly fought contest had its share of twists and turns, including dropped chances and a missed review. In the 11th over, India missed out on an opportunity to review for an LBW against Wade. Initially, India didn't seem too keen on taking the review. However, it flashed on the big screen that it was three reds. Kohli then wanted to take the review but the on-field umpires decided to disallow, as it was already shown on the big screen. The match also witnessed India giving Maxwell a couple of reprieves. Even Australia were quite sloppy in the field, with Kohli getting three chances. Steve Smith dropped the easiest of the opportunities offered by Kohli, putting down a sitter at deep midwicket in the third over.
