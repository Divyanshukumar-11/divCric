          In the months of nothingness and lockdown in 2020, courtesy a pandemic, Hardik Pandya spent time finding out what his next big focus was to be. Leading up to the IPL in September-November, a lot of conversations between the brothers in the Pandya household was about Hardik being able to 'finish games where it matters the most.'
          <br><br>
          Hardik ended the IPL 2020 season with 281 runs - his second-best effort in terms of runs in the six seasons he's played. More importantly, those came at a jaw-dropping strike-rate of 178.98. Only Kieron Pollard (268 runs at 191.43) and Jofra Archer (113 runs at 179.37) managed to better Hardik's efforts in the season.
          <br><br>
          "I felt that throughout the IPL I was batting well. It's just that when I feel it is my time to do it and the team wins, that's the happiest [feeling]," Hardik said, after having taken India over the line in the second T20I in Sydney to seal the series.
          <br><br>
          As Daniel Sams stood over his run-up ahead of the last over with 14 to defend, he made a tough call of switching to around the stumps. In his brief career so far, Hardik has shown an incredible propensity to clear leg side fields with greater ease, and - as evidenced during the IPL this year - his range of shots have also been upgraded.
          <br><br>
          But Sams had to bowl to Hardik's favourable angle, because of how short the boundaries were on the off-side at the SCG from that batting end. The length of the leg side boundary however, didn't make an iota of a difference as Hardik stayed deep in his crease and unfurled two big hits over long on to cap off the chase in style.
          <br><br>
          Hardik admitted being one of the many Indian players to have seamlessly transferred prime form from the recently-concluded IPL to the Australia series, despite the difference in conditions and the ground dimension on offer in Australia. While he remained on the fence with regards to whether he was in the midst of the best batting phase of his career so far, he admitted being in a 'pretty good zone'.
